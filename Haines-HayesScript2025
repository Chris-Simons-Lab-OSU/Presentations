# Investigating odor-induced changes in taste perception in coffee  

[slide 2]
Cross-modal interactions are the integration of two senses. In my case, as a food scientist, this is taste and smell. The result of cross-modal interactions could be the enhancement or suppression of a given attribute. One example of cross-modal interactions at work is adding vanilla extract to pudding can make it taste sweeter, although the vanilla extract did not add any sugar to the product (Wang et al. 2019). A previous study showed that adding strawberry flavor to sucrose made it taste sweeter than sucrose alone, but peanut butter odor did not show the same effect (Frank & Byram 1988). 

[slide 3]
This brings us to point #1 about how cross-modal interactions are likely to occur: in a congruent taste-odor pair. The authors suspected that strawberry was more strongly associated with sweetness (such as strawberry-flavored candy) than peanut butter (which could be sweet like PB fudge or savory like pad thai). The second condition is that "nutritive" tastes are needed. They are the tastes of sweet, salty, and umami. These three tastes signal important molecules needed for basic biological functioning (Lim et al. 2014).

[slide 4]
While sweet, salty, and umami tastes are considered "nutritive", bitter and sour are considered "non-nutritive" (Lim et al. 2014). For sourness, there are not many studies focusing on this tastes. One study found that lemon aroma, while highly congruent with sour taste, was unable to enhance perceived sourness (Lim et al. 2014). 

[slide 5]
There have been a few more studies looking at cross-modal interactions involving bitterness. One study (Caporale et al. 2004) found the bitterness of quinine was enhanced by adding a cut-grass odor. Another study found that the bitterness of caffeine was enhanced by adding a coffee odor (Keast 2008). 

[slide 6]
Of all the studies I’ve mentioned so far, cross-modal interactions have been tested using single odor/taste mixtures.  
This is not how most people consume food and beverages in daily life. Do cross-modal interactions occur in more complex solutions that more closely represent food you and I would recognize? I also wanted to challenge whether tastes like bitterness and sourness (again, considered “non-nutritive”) could participate in cross-modal interactions. 

[slide 7]
Coffee is known for its bitterness and sourness and is widely consumed around the world. It is also very complex, with many compounds contributing to its bitterness, sourness and aroma. Using coffee as the stimulus, I wanted to try and understand if coffee aroma could have an impact on the perception of bitterness and sourness through cross-modal interactions.

[slide 8]
Specifically, this research project will aim to answer 3 questions.
1. Can a coffee aroma increase perceived bitterness and sourness?
2. Could a coffee aroma increase perception of other tastes?
Here, salty is going to represent "other tastes."
3. If a coffee aroma can, do all odors increase perceived bitterness and sourness?
Here, banana aroma will represent "other aromas."
I hypothesize that coffee aroma can increase perceived bitterness and sourness through cross-modal interactions, but coffee aroma won’t increase the perception of other tastes. This is because I think coffee aroma will be congruent with bitterness and sourness to elicit cross-modal interactions.
I also hypothesize that other odors will not increase the perception of bitterness and sourness, going back to the condition of congruency. 

[slide 9]
I chose banana to be the representative “other odor” because it is not represented in the world coffee sensory lexicon (not generally represented in coffee) and banana is not typically associated with bitterness or sourness. Even a green banana is not very bitter or sour.
Salty works as a control because it is “nutritive” and is not typically associated with coffee. It is listed on the coffee lexicon, but it is listed under "chemical," more representative of a defect in specialty coffee. 
How do I get to my banana-flavored coffee?

[slide 10]
First I have to remove the aroma compounds from coffee. Here we are taking instant Folgers coffee and through a series of washes and freeze drying, we get a finished instant coffee product that is deodorized. 
Salt will be added to try to match the intensity of sourness or bitterness innate to the coffee sample. The banana aroma will try to match the intensity of coffee aroma in regular, undeodorized coffee. 

[slide 11]
We can confirm the decrease in volatiles using gas chromatography, and food safety (no residual hexane) through mass spectroscopy. 
Total dissolved solids and titratable acidity can be used to help ensure the different coffee samples are prepared in a similar manner, whether it is deodorized or not. We do not want the deodorizing process to make significant changes to the coffee so that the deodorized and coffee-odorized samples can be compared together.

[slide 12]
For the sensory method, I plan to recruit 30 coffee drinkers. They will do a paired comparison between a deodorized sample and an odorized sample, either a coffee aroma or a banana aroma. After they taste the two samples, they will say which is more intense, more bitter, more sour, or more salty.
They will also state how confident they are in choosing the more intense sample. Next, they will rate the taste intensity, and finally, rate the congruency, or how frequently the taste-aroma pair are seen in "everyday foods" (Lim et al. 2014). Participants will complete 2 sessions – one for coffee aroma comparisons, one for banana aroma comparisons. 

[slide 13]
For data analysis, the paired comparison and confidence data will be used to calculate an R-index. The intensity ratings and congruency ratings will by analyzed by t-tests. I'll get into the details more in a minute.

[slide 14]
R-index is a proportion of discrimination. Here is what the results might look like. I expect the coffee-odor samples to be selected more frequently as the more intense samples for bitterness and sourness, but not saltiness. I would not expect any sample in the banana-aroma condition to be chosen more frequently than the other, because I hypothesize that banana aroma is not congruent with bitter, sour, or salty.
If the bitter or sour samples are not chosen more frequently in the coffee-aroma condition, it could suggest that these "non-nutritive" tastes are unable to participate in cross-modal interactions.

[slide 15]
The intensity ratings will be analyzed by t-tests. This is what results might look like. Because I am only interested in how the deodorized sample compares to the odorized sample, I will run multiple t-tests with a Bonferroni correction. 
I expect to see the coffee-odorized samples to be significantly more bitter and more sour than the deodorized samples because I am hypothesizing that coffee aroma is congruent with bitterness and sourness, thereby allowing cross-modal interactions to occur. 
I do not expect any differences between the deodorized and odorized samples for salty taste because salty is not congruent with coffee aroma.  
In the banana aroma condition, I do not expect any differences between the ratings for either bitterness, sourness, or saltiness because I am assuming banana aroma is incongruent with these tastes. Here I am showing no differences in taste intensity in the banana aroma condition. It is possible that the banana-odor samples could significantly suppress the perceived bitterness, soutness, or saltiness of the samples. If this were to happen, it would show that an incongruous taste-odor pair can show suppression through cross-modal interactions.

[slide 16]
T-tests will also be used to test the differences in congruency ratings between each taste-odor pairing. Here is what that data might look like. Again, a Bonferroni correction will be used, as I'm comparing 2 aromas in 3 taste categories. 
I'm expecting that the coffee+bitter/sour samples will be significantly more congruent than the banana-odor samples. I do not expect to see any differences between the congruency of either aroma and saltiness.
Within in this design, there are some limitations. First, the deodorized coffee is not odor-less, but greatly reduced in intensity. Secondly, this design assumes that banana odor is not congruent with bitter or sour tastes. We can test this assumption by asking for congruency of the banana-taste mixtures. A third limitation could be sensory adaptation or fatigue. Coffee is quite a strong stimulus, and bitterness, sourness, or other attributes could linger beyond the time it takes to complete the evaluation. Rinising the palate with water and crackers can help limit this, as well as breaking the test into two sessions, which is what I’m proposing here.
This proposed study aims to investigate how coffee aroma can influence the perception of bitterness and sourness through cross-modal interactions. It aims to test the congruency between coffee odor and bitter and sour tastes, the nutritive hypothesis, and it aims to test cross-modal interactions in a consumer-relevant context.
Thank you.
