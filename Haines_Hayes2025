# Investigating odor-induced changes
of taste perception in coffee
Matthiew Haines
Hayes Research Forum 2025

<!-- Slide number: 2 -->
Are the integration of two senses
Can result in enhancement or suppression of an attribute
Focused on how odor influences taste perception
# Cross-modal interactions (CMI)

![The graph shows the relationship between sucrose concentration and maximal sweetness, comparing two conditions: no odor and strawberry odor. The "no odor" condition is represented by solid circles, while the "strawberry odor" is shown with open circles. Both conditions exhibit an increase in sweetness as sucrose concentration increases, but the strawberry odor consistently results in higher levels of sweetness across all concentrations.](Picture5.jpg)

![The graph shows the relationship between sucrose concentration and maximal sweetness, comparing two conditions: no odor and peanut butter odor. Both conditions exhibit an increase in sweetness as sucrose concentration increases, but the curve with peanut butter odor is consistently higher, indicating enhanced sweetness perception under that condition.](Picture7.jpg)

Nutritive Taste

<!-- Slide number: 4 -->
Sourness
Not many studies focusing on CMI of sour taste
Lim’s work (2014) found no effect of citral on sourness perception

# Sour and bitter are not considered 
“nutritive tastes”

![The bar chart displays the congruency rating of three substances: Sucrose, Citric acid, and Caffeine. Sucrose has the highest rating at around 80, followed by Citric acid at approximately 70, while Caffeine has the lowest rating near 30.](Picture6.jpg)

![The bar graph compares the perceived sourness intensity of citric acid, citral + citric acid, and coffee odor. Citric acid has the highest intensity, followed by citral + citric acid, while coffee odor has the lowest intensity. Error bars indicate variability in measurements.](Picture17.jpg)

### Notes:

Stevenson et al. 1999 (right)
Angelica oil – peppery odor
Cedryl aldehyde – cedar wood like odor

Sourness
Not many studies focusing on CMI of sour taste
Lim’s work (2014) found no effect of citral on sourness perception
Bitterness
Caporale (2004) saw cut grass odor enhanced quinine bitterness in model olive oil
Keast (2008) saw enhancement of caffeine by coffee odor

# Sour and bitter are not considered 
“nutritive tastes”

![Line graph of bitterness intensity against quinine concentration. Black circles represent bitterness intensity without an odorant added. Black triangles represent the bitterness intensity when a cut grass odorant was added. The line with the black trangles is above the black circle line suggesting bitterness was enhanced when a cut gradd odorant was added. ](Picture2.jpg)

![Bar graph showing gLMS bitterness intensity of different coffee samples, including varying concentrations and flavors like milk, mocha, and chocolate. Error bars indicate variability in measurements.](Picture5.jpg)

### Notes:
Lim et al. 2014 (left)

Angelica oil – peppery odor
Cedryl aldehyde – cedar wood like odor

<!-- Slide number: 6 -->
# One major limitation of previous studies is that they use mixtures of one taste and one odor.

<!-- Slide number: 7 -->
Bitterness and sourness are part of the coffee consumer experience
Complex mixture of compounds eliciting bitter and sour tastes
Widely consumed and consumer-relevant
# Coffee as a complex sensory stimulus

Each icon is simple and stylized, emphasizing the type of drink without intricate details.](Picture5.jpg)

AROMA

volatiles
nonvolatiles
TASTE
Can coffee aroma influence taste through
cross-modal interactions?

<!-- Slide number: 8 -->
Can a coffee aroma enhance perceived bitterness and sourness?
Can a coffee aroma enhance the perception of other tastes?
Can a non-coffee aroma enhance perceived bitterness and sourness?
# Research Questions

<!-- Slide number: 9 -->
Banana aroma is not listed in the lexicon or flavor wheel used by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA)
Salty is listed under chemical, a defect in specialty coffee
Assumes neither banana aroma nor salty taste are congruent with coffee
# Banana Aroma
Salty Taste

![A circular infographic displays various flavors and aromas associated with different types of beverages, such as wine, whiskey, and beer. Each segment represents a distinct flavor profile, ranging from sweet to sour, with colors indicating intensity or prominence.](Picture9.jpg)

### Notes:
10-31-24: will dump purple block, not a direct control
Coffee + salty and banana + bitter are controls

<!-- Slide number: 13 -->
R-index
Uses 2-AFC and confidence data
t-Tests
Uses gLMS ratings
Uses congruency ratings

# Data analysis

### Notes:
For the t-test – can we hypothesize coffee odor will be more congruent a priori?

<!-- Slide number: 14 -->

![The image displays two bar charts comparing the intensity of bitter, sour, and salty flavors between deodorized and odorized samples using banana and coffee as references. The top chart shows higher percentages for all three flavors in both samples, while the bottom chart indicates that the deodorized sample has lower flavor intensity compared to the odorized one. Asterisks suggest statistical significance.](Picture6.jpg)
Proportion of discrimination
Expect the coffee-odor samples to be selected more frequently as the “more bitter” and 
“more sour” sample
Do not expect any difference in which salty sample is selected
# R-Index

<!-- Slide number: 15 -->

![The image displays a 3x2 grid of box plots comparing intensity levels of bitter, sour, and salty flavors between deodorized and odorized conditions for banana and coffee samples. Each subplot shows the distribution of flavor intensity scores, highlighting differences in median values and variability between the two conditions.](Picture10.jpg)
Differences in taste intensity within comparisons
Bonferroni corrected α = 0.05/6
Expect to see differences in bitterness and sourness intensities
Expect no difference in saltiness intensity
# T-Test - Rating

### Notes:
Or multiple t-tests

<!-- Slide number: 16 -->
Differences in congruency across odorants
Bonferroni corrected 
α = 0.05/3
Expect to see bitter and sour more congruent with coffee aroma
Expect to see no differences in banana aroma
# T-Test - Congruency

![The bar chart displays the congruency between banana and coffee in bitter, sour, and salty contexts. Banana has lower congruency compared to coffee across all three taste categories. The asterisk indicates statistical significance in the bitter context.](Picture6.jpg)

<!-- Slide number: 17 -->
# Limitations

Deodorized coffee is not odor-less coffee

Assumes banana is not congruent 
with sour and bitter taste

Sensory adaptation or fatigue

# Implications of this study
Leverage cross-modal interactions in product development

### Notes:
1. If aroma can impact coffee bitterness, it could be leveraged to create more balanced coffee profiles, influencing bitterness and sourness
