# Investigating odor-induced changes in taste perception in coffee  

# Cross-Modal Interactions (CMI)  
- Are the integration of two senses
- Can result in enhancement or suppression of an attribute
- Focused on how odor influences taste perception

*The graph shows the relationship between sucrose concentration and maximal sweetness, comparing two conditions: no odor and strawberry odor. The "no odor" condition is represented by solid circles, while the "strawberry odor" is shown with open circles. Both conditions exhibit an increase in sweetness as sucrose concentration increases, but the strawberry odor consistently results in higher levels of sweetness across all concentrations.*

*Three ripe strawberries, two whole and one cut in half, display vibrant red color with yellow seeds on the surface and fresh green leaves attached to their stems against a white background.*

*The graph shows the relationship between sucrose concentration and maximal sweetness, comparing two conditions: no odor and peanut butter odor. Both conditions exhibit an increase in sweetness as sucrose concentration increases, but the curve with peanut butter odor is consistently higher, indicating enhanced sweetness perception under that condition.*

*A glass bowl filled with smooth, creamy peanut butter is surrounded by several whole peanuts on a white background. The peanut butter has a rich brown color and appears freshly made or well-maintained.*

# Hypotheized Conditions for CMI  
1. Congruent Taste-Odor Pair  
*Three ripe strawberries, two whole and one cut in half, display vibrant red color with yellow seeds on the surface and fresh green leaves attached to their stems against a white background.*  
*A glass bowl filled with smooth, creamy peanut butter is surrounded by several whole peanuts on a white background. The peanut butter has a rich brown color and appears freshly made or well-maintained.*  

2. Nutritive Tastant
*Three pristine white sugar cubes stacked together, showcasing their smooth texture and cubic shape against a stark white background.*  
*A clear glass salt shaker filled with white salt, featuring a shiny metal lid, set against a plain white background.*  
*A partially open silver foil packet reveals a spill of yellow powder, possibly spices or seasoning, scattered on a white surface.*  

# Sour and bitter are not considered "nutritive tastes"
- Sourness  
  + Not many studies focusing on CMI of sour taste
  + Lim’s work (2014) found no effect of citral on sourness perception

*The bar chart displays the congruency rating of three substances: Sucrose, Citric acid, and Caffeine. Sucrose has the highest rating at around 80, followed by Citric acid at approximately 70, while Caffeine has the lowest rating near 30.*  
*The bar graph compares the perceived sourness intensity of citric acid, citral + citric acid, and coffee odor. Citric acid has the highest intensity, followed by citral + citric acid, while coffee odor has the lowest intensity. Error bars indicate variability in measurements.*  

*A juicy, ripe slice of lemon with vibrant yellow flesh and a textured rind, set against a white background.*

# Sour and bitter are not considered "nutritive tastes"
- Sourness  
  + Not many studies focusing on CMI of sour taste
  + Lim’s work (2014) found no effect of citral on sourness perception
- Bitterness 
  + Caporale (2004) saw cut grass odor enhanced quinine bitterness in model olive oil
  + Keast (2008) saw enhancement of caffeine by coffee odor  
  
*Line graph of bitterness intensity against quinine concentration. Black circles represent bitterness intensity without an odorant added. Black triangles represent the bitterness intensity when a cut grass odorant was added. The line with the black triangles is above the black circle line suggesting bitterness was enhanced when a cut graSS odorant was added.*  

*A cluster of green grass blades against a white background, showcasing varying lengths and angles, with some leaves bending slightly to the right.*  

*Bar graph showing gLMS bitterness intensity of different coffee samples, including varying concentrations and flavors like milk, mocha, and chocolate. Error bars indicate variability in measurements.* 

*Black and white cartoon drawing of three coffee beans*  

# One major limitation of previous studies is that they use mixtures of one taste and one odor.  
 
# Coffee as a complex sensory stimulus
- Bitterness and sourness are part of the coffee consumer experience  
- Complex mixture of compounds eliciting bitter and sour tastes  
- Widely consumed and consumer-relevant  
- **Can coffee aroma influence taste through cross-modal interactions?**

*A line drawing of a hot coffee to-go cup. Above the cup is a squiggle representing the coffee aroma. Above the image is text "AROMA volatiles" and below the image is the text "TASTE nonvolatiles".*

# Research Questions
- Can a coffee aroma enhance perceived bitterness and sourness?  
- Can a coffee aroma enhance the perception of other tastes?
- Can a non-coffee aroma enhance perceived bitterness and sourness?

*A cup labeled sour with an aroma squiggle and a banana cartoon. A red arrow points from the banana aroma to the cup. Inside the cup is an up arrow and a question mark.*

# Banana Aroma Salty Taste
- Banana aroma is not listed in the lexicon or flavor wheel used by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA)
- Salty is listed under chemical, a defect in specialty coffee
- Assumes neither banana aroma nor salty taste are congruent with coffee

*A circular infographic displays various flavors and aromas associated with different types of beverages, such as wine, whiskey, and beer. Each segment represents a distinct flavor profile, ranging from sweet to sour, with colors indicating intensity or prominence.*

*A red rectangle highlights where salty is listed on the infographic.*

# Deodorizing Coffee  
- Want to remove aroma compounds while retaining taste compounds

*Method of removing aromatic compounds from instant coffee. On the left, a bubble labeled instant coffee. A black arrow points right at a bubble labeled "remove volatiles". A black arrow points right at a bubble labeled "add banana aroma"*

*A flowchart describing how volatiles are removed from instant coffee.*

# Instrumental Analysis
- Gas chromatography
  + Compare peak area of odorized and deodorized coffee
- Total Dissolved Solids
   + Ensure preparation of samples are the same
- Titratable Acidity
  + Compare total acid between odorized and deodorized coffee

*A cup labeled coffee with an aroma squiggle and a coffee bean cartoon. *
*A cup labeled coffee with an aroma squiggle and a coffee bean cartoon. A red "not allowed" symbol is over the aroma and coffee bean cartoon, symbolizing deodorized coffee.*
  
# The Method
- 30 coffee drinkers
- Paired comparison on relevant attribute (bitter, sour, salty)
- Confidence rating
- Intensity rating on relevant attribute
- Congruency rating of each taste-odor pair 

*A grid of cups in 4 columns by 3 rows. The cups in the first row are labeled "bitter". The cups in the second row are labeled "Sour". The cups in the thrid row are labed "salty". The first and third column refers to deodorized coffee. The second column refers to coffee-odored coffee. A blue dashed line separates the second and thrid columns. The fourth column refers to banana-odored coffee.*

# Data analysis
- R-index
  + Uses 2-AFC and confidence data
- t-Tests
  + Uses gLMS ratings
  + Uses congruency ratings

# R-Index
- Proportion of discrimination
- Expect the coffee-odor samples to be selected more frequently as the “more bitter” and “more sour” sample
- Do not expect any difference in which salty sample is selected

*The image displays two bar charts comparing the intensity of bitter, sour, and salty flavors between deodorized and odorized samples using banana and coffee as references. The top chart shows higher percentages for all three flavors in both samples, while the bottom chart indicates that the deodorized sample has lower flavor intensity compared to the odorized one. Asterisks suggest statistical significance.*

# T-Test - Rating
- Differences in taste intensity within comparisons
- Bonferroni corrected α = 0.05/6
- Expect to see differences in bitterness and sourness intensities
- Expect no difference in saltiness intensity

*The image displays a 3x2 grid of box plots comparing intensity levels of bitter, sour, and salty flavors between deodorized and odorized conditions for banana and coffee samples. Each subplot shows the distribution of flavor intensity scores, highlighting differences in median values and variability between the two conditions.*

# T-Test - Congruency
- Differences in congruency across odorants
- Bonferroni corrected α = 0.05/3
- Expect to see bitter and sour more congruent with coffee aroma
- Expect to see no differences in banana aroma

*The bar chart displays the congruency between banana and coffee in bitter, sour, and salty contexts. Banana has lower congruency compared to coffee across all three taste categories. The asterisk indicates statistical significance in the bitter context.*

# Limitations
*Each of the following bullet points are in a red rectangle*
- Deodorized coffee is not odor-less coffee *paired with cartoon of hot coffee mug with aroma squiggles above the cup*
- Assumes banana is not congruent 
with sour and bitter taste *paired with a cartoon of a bunch of bananas*
- Sensory adaptation or fatigue *paired with a line drawing of a tongue*

# Implications of this study
1. Leverage cross-modal interactions in product development
2. Improve ecological validity of studies focusing on cross-modal interactions
3. Challenge the “nutritive tastant” hypothesis
